# AI Playground

This is my AI Playground: a personal space to write down ideas and experiments I want to implement and test.
I’ll keep updating this repo as my ideas and fields of interest evolve.

## Current Ideas

| Idea                                                                 | Description                                                                                     |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Using AI in scientific research and writing                          | Exploring how AI can assist in research workflows, literature review, and scientific writing. |
| [Using agentic workflows for retrieving information from the internet](./RAG/MistralOCR.md) | Testing agentic workflows for extracting and synthesizing information, e.g., from scientific papers. |
| [Exploring Mistral Models](./Mistral.md)                            | Testing Mistral's open-source and API-based models for various use cases.                      |
| Using Mistral LLM's within Continue vs code extension                | Comparing Mistral models with GitHub Copilot Agents for coding and development tasks.
| Trying new agentic coding workflows                                  | Experimenting with AI-driven coding assistants and workflows.                                  |
| Using agent skills | move custom instruction logic from instruction, agent or prompt files to skills                      |
| Code Safety and Quality | Use tools like SonarQuebe for Code quality and Security as static code analyses | 
# Talks I attended

## [Code smarter not harder - Daniel Sogl](https://speakerdeck.com/danielsogl/code-smarter-net-meetup-karlsruhe-january-2026?slide=2)

really interesting data and thoughts about current ai trends. Here some insights I got from the presentation and the discussion.

- the developer role is evolving and ai can be a lever for productivity
- agent skills are the new alternative for instruction files
- openspec is the better alternative compared to speckit
- Using more tools to ensure ai generated Code quality and Security. For example SonarQube, ESLint, Ruff(Python Linter)
- use prompt library to get good working prompts and instructions 

## [Agentic ProbLLMs: Exploiting AI](https://media.ccc.de/v/39c3-agentic-probllms-exploiting-ai-computer-use-and-coding-agents#t=761)

real interesting talk about prompt injection
