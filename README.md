# AI Playground

This is my AI Playground: a personal space to write down ideas and experiments I want to implement and test.

## Current Ideas

| Idea                                                                 | Description                                                                                     |

| Using AI in scientific research and writing                          | Exploring how AI can assist in research workflows, literature review, and scientific writing. |
| [Using agentic workflows for retrieving information from the internet](./RAG/MistralOCR.md) | Testing agentic workflows for extracting and synthesizing information, e.g., from scientific papers. |
| [Exploring Mistral Models](./Mistral.md)                            | Testing Mistral's open-source and API-based models for various use cases.                      |
| Trying new agentic coding workflows                                  | Experimenting with AI-driven coding assistants and workflows.                                  |
| Using Mistral LLM's within Continue vs code extension                | Comparing Mistral models with GitHub Copilot Agents for coding and development tasks.


I’ll keep updating this repo as my ideas and fields of interest evolve.
