# AI Playground

This is my AI Playground: a personal space to write down ideas and experiments I want to implement and test.

## Current ideas

- Using AI in scientific research and writing
- Using agentic workflows for retrieving information from the internet (e.g., from scientific papers)
  - testing Mistral OCR 3 
- Trying new agentic coding workflows

I’ll keep updating this repo as my ideas and fields of interest evolve.
