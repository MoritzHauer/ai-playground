# Exploring Mistral Models

Mistral AI is a cutting-edge AI lab based in France, focused on developing advanced large language models. I am particularly interested in their work because:

- **EU-Based Company**: Mistral is a European company, which aligns with my preference for supporting and using technologies developed within the EU.
- **Open-Source Models**: Mistral offers a variety of open-source models, which can be self-hosted and customized for specific use cases.
- **Transparent Pricing**: Their API pricing model is based on token usage, which is cost-effective and scalable for experimentation and production.

## Experiments and Experiences

### Mistral Models Tried

1. **Ministral 3 8B Model**
   - **Use Case**: Ran the model locally on my notebook to test its performance and output quality.
   - **Observations**: The output quality was impressive, but the performance was slow due to the lack of GPU acceleration. I had hoped it would run better on RAM and CPU, but it seems GPU acceleration is necessary for a smoother experience.

2. **[Mistral OCR 3 for RAG](./RAG/MistralOCR.md)**
   - **Use Case**: Tested Mistral's OCR capabilities for extracting text from documents (PDFs, images) and integrating it into a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) workflow.
   - **Observations**: The OCR system worked well for extracting text and images from documents, making it a promising tool for document-heavy workflows.

### Next Steps and Ideas

Here are some ideas for further exploration:

1. **Integration with Agentic Workflows**
   - Use Mistral models as part of agentic workflows for tasks like:
     - Automated literature review and summarization.
     - Code generation and debugging assistance.
     - Multilingual document processing and translation.

2. **Comparing Mistral with GitHub Copilot and Other Tools**
   - Evaluate Mistral's performance within the Continue VS Code extension and compare it with GitHub Copilot Agents.
   - Focus on usability, response quality, and integration with development workflows.

3. **Community and Collaboration**
   - Engage with the Mistral community to stay updated on new releases, best practices, and use cases.
   - Contribute to open-source projects or share findings and experiments in forums or blogs.
