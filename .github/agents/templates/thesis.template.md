Writing & Citation Rules:
- Each factual or comparative claim in chapters 2–6 must be cited.
- Avoid redundancy across chapters (results vs discussion separation).
- Use consistent terminology defined in Abbreviations.
- Distinguish between method limitations (3.8) and broader study limitations (5.5).
- Ensure all tables/figures referenced at least once in text.
