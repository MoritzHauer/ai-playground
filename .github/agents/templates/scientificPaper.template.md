## Abstract
<150–250 word concise summary: background, objective, methods, key results (with metrics + units), principal conclusion. No citations.>

**Keywords:** <keyword1>; <keyword2>; <keyword3>; <keyword4>; <keyword5>

## 1. Introduction
- Background context (cite foundational sources).  
- Problem definition.  
- Gap in existing literature (cite reviews + conflicting studies).  
- Objective / research question(s) / hypothesis.  

## 2. Methods
### 2.1 Study Design / Experimental Setup
<Design type (e.g., RCT, cohort, simulation).>

### 2.2 Data / Materials
- Sources, datasets (with accession IDs, DOIs).  
- Inclusion / exclusion criteria.  
- Ethical approvals / IRB number if applicable.  

### 2.3 Procedures / Protocol
<Stepwise procedures; instrumentation; configurations; parameter values.>

### 2.4 Algorithms / Models
- Model architectures / equations / assumptions.  
- Hyperparameters and training regimes.  

### 2.5 Statistical / Analytical Methods
- Metrics (e.g., accuracy, F1, RMSE).  
- Statistical tests (significance levels, corrections).  
- Software & versions.  

### 2.6 Limitations of Methods
<List known methodological constraints.>

## 3. Results
- Present primary outcomes first (tables/figures referenced).  
- Secondary / exploratory results.  
- Provide quantitative metrics with units and confidence intervals.  
- Avoid interpretation (reserve for Discussion).  

### 3.1 Figures & Tables
```

Table 1: <Caption>
```

## 4. Discussion
- Interpret principal findings relative to objectives.  
- Comparison with prior literature (cite similar & contradictory work).  
- Mechanisms / theoretical implications.  
- Practical / clinical / engineering implications.  
- Limitations (distinct from method limitations).  
- Recommendations / future work.

## 5. Conclusion
<1–3 concise paragraphs summarizing contribution + impact without repetition.>

## Acknowledgments
